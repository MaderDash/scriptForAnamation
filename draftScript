Meet Peter. 

Peter has just started to get into Arduino, and is having a hard time with his project. He heard about a place where he may be able to get help with his current project.

  In the Arduino server, there are people with skill levels from beginner, all the way up to professionals. But Peter is not sure where to ask for help. Peter sees the welcome channel, after reading over the rules he sees that there is a recommended way to ask questions, and  several channels that he can ask his question in. It is best thought that the better your question with details, the faster, and better the answer peter can get.

  The Arduino server has also got code blocks. Code-blocks is a simple way of sharing code in the server for others to be able to catch mistakes. In no time, Peter has received assistance on his project, and it is now working. However, Peter noticed that in another channel someone is having issues, but Peter just got done solving that the other day and is excited to assist someone else so soon already.

  Now, meet Trollface898.

  Troll face likes Trolling discord servers, and calling people NOOBS in order to make himself feel smart and make himself feel better.

What will this mean for Peter, and others that have been helping him?
Arduino Server strives to maintain a helpful, respectful environment. Reporting behavior that is toxic, abusive and  evasively vulgar helps our mods to catch trolls that try to disrupt the server. 

  Along with this, the Arduino server does not permit open arguing, direct messages, spamming, or posting the same message on multiple channels. 

  If you want to get a quick and helpful response, being rude, very vague or not listening to the staff is not the way to do it.
