Meet Joe.

Joe has just started to get into Arduino, and is having a hard time with his project. He heard about a place where he may be able to get help with his current project.

  In the Arduino server, there are people with skill levels from beginner, all the way up to professionals. But Joe is not sure where to ask for help. Joe sees the welcome channel, after reading over the rules he sees that there is a recommended way to ask questions, and  several channels that he can ask his question in. The better your question with details, the faster, and better the answer Joe can get.

  The Arduino server has also got code blocks. Code-blocks is a simple way of sharing code in the server for others to be able to catch mistakes. In no time, Joe has received assistance on his project, and it is now working.
  Joe noticed that in another channel someone is having issues, and Joe was Just working on that the other day and is excited to assist someone else so soon already.

  Now, meet Trollface898.

  Troll face likes Trolling discord servers, and calling people NOOBS in order to make himself feel smart and, feel better.

What will this mean for Joe, and others that have been helping him?
The Arduino Server strives to maintain a helpful, respectful environment. Reporting behavior that is toxic, abusive and  evasively vulgar helps our mods to catch trolls that try to disrupt the server.

  Along with this, the Arduino server does not permit open arguing, direct messages others, spamming, or posting the same message on multiple channels.

  If you want to get a quick and helpful response, being rude, very vague, or not listening to the staff is not the way to do it.
